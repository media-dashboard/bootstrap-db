### Setup DB

run `./init.sh` to set up all postgres tables.  The `init` script will delete the database (called `gdelt` by default) if it already exists, so be careful to only run it when you want to rebuild from scratch.

### Download GDELT

Run `node index.js`.  Configure date ranges in script settings.
